- 👋 Hi, I’m @JayGrace or (Jay) John E. Grace Jr.
- 👀 I’m a network & NOC engineer who has drifted into scripting and really into automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ansible and Scale (1E Tachyon)
- 💞️ I won't know what I want to collaborate on until I get the boundaries of my new position worked out.
- 📫 I'll update the "reach me" info after I get settled.
